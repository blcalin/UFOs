The purpose of this project was to display and organize UFO data into a table through a JavaScript array. In order to assist the client, JavaScript, HTML/CSS and Bootstrap were used to create a dynamic website with the ability to filter by multiple criteria.
### Data
Data presented includes information such as date, city, state/country, shape of UFO, duration and comments regarding the UFO seen.

## Summary
In order to appropriately utilize the site, users must know specific dates, cities or shapes to search. Additionally, fields are case-sensitive, requiring the user to correctly use lower case with no spaces.

### Additional Recommendations
Overall, the use of this data can be very helpful for future analysis. I would recommend the following:
1. Allow users to enter non-case sensitive information (ex: uppercase letters) in order to enhance the user experience.
2. The use of a date range, such as a dropdown menu for month and/or year, to further results would be useful for users.
